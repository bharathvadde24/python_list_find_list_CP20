Question: Find Element in List

In this coding question, you are given a list L
 with some elements. Your task is to read a string S
 and check if S
 is present in the list L
. If S
 is present in L
, print True. Otherwise, print False.

The given list L
 is:
Approach

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

    Read the input string S
    .
    Check if the input string S
    is present in the list L
    .
    Print the result.

Step-by-Step Explanation

Step 1: Read the input string

First, we need to read the input string S
. We can use the input()
 function to read the input.
PYTHON

Step 2: Check if the input string is present in the list

Now, we need to check if the input string S
 is present in the list L
. We can use a for
 loop to iterate through the elements of the list L
. Inside the loop, we will compare each element with the input string S
. If the element is equal to S
, we will set a variable is_present
 to True
 and break the loop.
PYTHON

Step 3: Print the result

Finally, we will print the result. If the input string S
 is present in the list L
, the variable is_present
 will be True
. Otherwise, it will be False
.
